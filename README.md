  #La Familia
  
The Torres-Ortiz family was originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Here we have documented their immigration story from Puerto Rico to New York in the 1940's and later to San Francisco, California in the late-1950's. The family's story highlights several distinct societal issues of their time. Such as segregation and socioeconomic status. In this exhibit we will introduce you to all members of the family and share with you how they moved indivdually and as a unit across the United States.
