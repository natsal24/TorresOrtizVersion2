# The Torrez-Ortiz Family 
 
The Torres-Ortiz family was originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico. We have documented their immigration story from Puerto Rico to New York in the 1940's and later to San Francisco, California in the late-1950's. The family's story highlights several distinct societal issues of their time. Though on the surface their story might seem like the story of thousands of other Puerto Ricans that also immigrated to the United States during the Great Migration, this family gives us a different insight on how race and socioeconomic status could greatly affect Puerto Rican's ability to thrive in a seperate but equal America. In this exhibit we will introduce you to all members of the family and share with you how they moved indivdually and as a unit across the United States.
